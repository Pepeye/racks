Exploring the rust programing language

## Prerequisites

The easiest way to get Cargo is to install the current stable release of **Rust** by using `rustup`.

On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:

```sh
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
It will download a script, and start the installation. If everything goes well, you’ll see this appear:

```sh
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

## code

```rust
fn main() {
    // some code implementation
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
